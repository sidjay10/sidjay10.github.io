## üñ•Ô∏è Work

### Jul 2021 - Present ¬∑ [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/) ###
**Research Fellow**

**Mentors:** [Akash Lal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/akashl/), [Kapil Vaswani](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/kapilv/), [Pantazis Deligiannis](https://pdeligia.github.io/)

I currently work as a [research fellow](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/research-fellows-program-at-microsoft-research-india/) at Microsoft Research India.
My research focuses on designing sytems and protocols to technologically guarantee data privacy compliance for microservies running in Trusted Execution Environments on trusted execution on [Azure Confidential Computing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/solutions/confidential-compute/).


### Oct 2020 - May 2021 ¬∑ [CAR3S Research Group, IIT Kanpur](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~biswa/mentees.html) ###
**Undergraduate Researcher**

**Mentor:** [Biswabandan Panda](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~biswa/index.html)

I ported the [Valgrind](https://valgrind.org/) debugger to run on android-aarch64 & android-amd64 and built [csTracer](https://github.com/sidjay10/cstracer), a tool for tracing android applications without requiring thier source code. I collected traces of geekbench5 and AnTuTu using cstracer and profiled their memory access patterns.

Read more about tracing android applications with cstracer and some preliminary results from simulating these traces on arm cortexA77 & cortexA55 cores [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ItN-Z4M6NXTQTMUEJOMCRhUswRGA3jiho9J-yJkvMzM/edit)

### Mar 2020 - Jul 2020 ¬∑ [PARSA, EPFL](https://parsa.epfl.ch/) ###
**External Student**

**Mentor:** [Yunho Oh](https://yunho-oh.github.io/)

I worked on understanding the performance characteristics of container-level horizontal and vertical scaling of [CloudSuite](https://github.com/parsa-epfl/cloudsuite) benchmark workloads on server CPUs.

### Dec 2019 - Feb 2020 ¬∑ [Processor Architecture Reserach Lab, Intel](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in) ###
**Undergraduate Research Intern**

**Mentors:** [Sreenivas Subramoney](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sreenivas-subramoney-i-am-hiring-6564521/), [Anant Nori](https://in.linkedin.com/in/anant-nori-97a491152)

I worked on developing an L2 prefetcher that can negate the performance drop caused by reducing the size of the L2 cache. My work extends the idea of reducing L2 cache sizes to save chip area without adversely affecting performance presented in [Criticality Aware Tiered Cache Hierarchy, Nori et al](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8416821)

### May 2019 - Jul 2019 ¬∑ [Department of Computer Science & Automation, IISc Bangalore](https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~arindamkhan/) ###
**Summer Intern**


**Mentor:** [Arindam Khan](https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~arindamkhan/)

I worked as an intern in the Algorithms, Combinatorics and Optimizations Group on developing a new polynomial time approximation algorithm to improve the 2 approximation bound of [Steinberg's 2D strip packing algorithm](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/S0097539793255801).
