Hey there! Welcome to my homepage. 

I currently work as a Research Fellow in the systems group at Microsoft Research India. My current research focuses on designing systems and protocols for applications running in Trusted Execution Environments to technologically guarantee data privacy compliance and enforcement. I'm currently investigating secure communication and remote attestation verification for microservices running in TEEs.

In 2021, I graduated from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur with a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering. I also spent time at EPFL, Intel Labs, IISc Bangalore.

My research interests span computer architecture, operating systems, compilers and programming languages. I am excited by all things systems, software and programning. In my spare time, I love hacking around different types of systems.
