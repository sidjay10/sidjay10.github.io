Hey there! Welcome to my homepage. 

I currently work as a Research Fellow in the systems group at Microsoft Research India. My current research focuses on designing protocols for secure communication and remote attestation verification of services running in secure execution environments to preserve data privacy.

In 2021, I graduated from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur with a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering. I also spent time at EPFL, Intel Labs, IISc Bangalore.

I am deeply interested in all things systems, software and programming languages. I love toying around with different aspects of systems...

I also write a blog where I typically examine the workings of systems under the hood. If you're interested :/, you can find my writings [here]().
