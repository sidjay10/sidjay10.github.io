Hey there! Welcome to my homepage.

I am a first year PhD student in the Computer Science Department at Carnegie Mellon University.

My research interests span computer architecture, operating systems, compilers, programming languages, cryptography and secure computation. I am excited by all things systems, software and programming. In my spare time, I love hacking around different types of systems.

I spent a year as a Research Fellow in the systems group at Microsoft Research India, where I worked on designing systems and protocols for applications running in Trusted Execution Environments to technologically guarantee data privacy compliance and enforcement.

In 2021, I graduated from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur with a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering. I also spent a semester as an exchange student at EPFL. I have also worked as an intern at Intel Labs and IISc Bangalore.
