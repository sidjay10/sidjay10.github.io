Hey there! Welcome to my homepage.

I am a PhD student in the Computer Science Department at Carnegie Mellon University advised by Prof. Wenting Zheng and Prof. Dimitrios Skarlatos.

My current research focuses on making secure computation efficient, practical and real. My broader research interests span computer architecture, operating systems, compilers, programming languages, cryptography and secure computation. I am excited by all things systems, software and programming. In my spare time, I love hacking around different types of systems.

Before starting my PhD, I spent a year as a Research Fellow in the systems group at Microsoft Research India, where I worked on designing systems and protocols for applications running in Trusted Execution Environments to technologically guarantee data privacy compliance and enforcement.

In 2021, I graduated from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur with a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering. I also spent a semester as an exchange student at EPFL and have worked as an intern at Intel Labs and IISc Bangalore.
