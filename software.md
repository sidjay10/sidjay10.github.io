### csTracer

A tool that can generate memory access and program execution traces of android applications without requiring source code access.

Source Code available on [Github](https://github.com/sidjay10/cstracer)

### C to MIPS32 Compiler

A compiler that compiles C code to the MIPS32 ISA. This compiler implements language features like multi level pointers, multi dimensional arrays, dynamic memory allocation, FILE I/O. It performs code optimisations like dead code elimination, constant folding and short circuit evaluation. This project was done as a part of the course CS335 - Compiler Design at IITK.

source Code available on  [Github](https://github.com/sidjay10/CS335-C-Compiler)

### Evaluation of State of the art Cache Replacement Policies
A comparitive study to evaluate state of the cache replacement policies - Hawkeye, SHiP and DRRiP usin SPEC CPU workloads. This project was done as a part of the course CS622 - Advanced Computer Architecture at IITK.

### Cache Simulator to study effects of architecture on replacment policies
A cache block simulator that measures the effect of replacement policy, cache associativity and hierarchy (Inclusive, Exclusive, NINE) on hit and miss rates. This project was done as a part of the course CS622 - Advanced Computer Architecture at IITK.

Source Code available on  [Github](https://github.com/sidjay10/CS622-A1)

### Cache miss analysis on loop nests
A program that parses nested for loops and arrays in java and evaluates the cache misses suffered by the loop nest. This project was done as a part of the course CS610 - Programming for Performance at IITK.

Source Code available on  [Github](https://github.com/sidjay10/loop_nest_cache_misses)

### FPGA synthesis of a simple processor

Synthesised a simple processor that implements instructions like add, subtract, compare, branch, load and store on an FPGA. This project was done as a part of the course CS220 - Computer Organization at IITK.
